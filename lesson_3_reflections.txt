Manual vs. Automatic pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Any changes you have made may not work with changes made upstream. 

Forks, Clones, and Branches

Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Use branches when you want to merge the code later. Use clone to make a local copy of a repository. Use fork to create a clone on github if you don't have permission to push changes to the original repository.
